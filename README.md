# Phylogenetics/Stochastic Processes Journal Club

[Shim Lab](http://heejungshim.org) and [Rao Lab](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~varao/) are reading papers related to phylogenetics, comparative genomics, applications of stochastic processes to those fields, etc. Feel free to email us if you'd like to join (even for a particular paper) or you have any suggestions.

* [Link to potential reading list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whiJnESn0UGmLAcO762KCNRg6JJXb2a5CqTBrDzeHqQ/edit)
* Meetings are on Thursday at 4pm unless otherwise stated.
