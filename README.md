# Phylogenetics/Stochastic Processes Journal Club

[Shim Lab](http://heejungshim.org), [Rao Lab](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~varao/), and [He Lab](http://xinhelab.org/) are reading papers related to phylogenetics, comparative genomics, applications of stochastic processes to those fields, etc. Feel free to email us if you'd like to join (even for a particular paper) or you have any suggestions.
